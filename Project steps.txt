prompt: I have the following assignment and I'm not sure how to get started, I need you to break it down into steps so I can get started with it. Keep in mind that I have access to YOLOv5 github
ASSIGNMENT DESCRIPTION: 
The dataset provided a collection of labeled images with labels: Forklift, Rack, Crate,
Floor, Railing, Pallet, Stillage, iwhub and dolly using BMW JSON format. You are 
requested to:
1. Load the dataset and labels (Using PyTorch DataLoader)
2. Write a function to visualize some of the labeled images (With bboxes)
3. Check the possibility of augmenting the dataset (Albumentations)
4. Split the Training dataset into train and validation.
5. Train an object detection model based on YOLOv5 
6. Evaluate the model on the Testing dataset and relaunch the training with 
different hyperparameters.
7. Train a custom semantic segmentation model using Pytorch (The model code 
should be written by the student and available in the GitHub repository; the architecture can be inspired by an existing model, but this needs to be clearly 
stated, bonus points if the model is directly inspired by a research paper)
8. Evaluate the semantic segmentation model on the Testing dataset and relaunch 
the training with different hyperparameters.
9. Use Tensorboard to visualize the evolution of both models’ metrics during 
training.
10.Interpret the difference in results between the object detection models and the 
semantic segmentation models separately (in terms of metrics: accuracy, iou,
training time, inference speed, hyperparams, etc .) 




Here's a step-by-step breakdown to get started with the assignment:

1. Load the Dataset and Labels Using PyTorch DataLoader
Understand the BMW JSON Format: First, explore the JSON files to understand how the annotations are structured (e.g., bounding boxes, class labels).
Create a Custom Dataset Class: Implement a torch.utils.data.Dataset class that:
Loads images from the directory.
Parses the JSON files to extract bounding boxes and labels.
Initialize DataLoader: Use torch.utils.data.DataLoader to create batches and shuffle the data.
2. Visualize Labeled Images with Bounding Boxes
Write a Visualization Function: Implement a function using libraries like matplotlib or opencv to:
Load an image.
Draw bounding boxes around objects using the coordinates from the JSON file.
Display the image with labels.
Test the Visualization: Run the function on a few images to ensure it works as expected.
3. Augment the Dataset Using Albumentations
Choose Augmentations: Select augmentations suitable for object detection (e.g., flipping, rotation, scaling, brightness adjustments).
Integrate with Dataset Class: Modify your custom dataset class to apply these augmentations during data loading.
Test the Augmentations: Visualize a few augmented images to ensure the transformations are correctly applied.
4. Split the Dataset into Train and Validation Sets
Create a Train-Validation Split: Use torch.utils.data.random_split or manual splitting to divide the dataset into training and validation subsets.
Update DataLoaders: Create separate DataLoaders for the training and validation datasets.
5. Train an Object Detection Model Based on YOLOv5
Fork the YOLOv5 Repository: Clone the YOLOv5 GitHub repository and follow the setup instructions.
Prepare the Dataset in YOLOv5 Format: Convert your dataset's labels and structure to match the format required by YOLOv5.
Train the Model: Run the training script provided by YOLOv5, adjusting parameters such as batch size, learning rate, and number of epochs.
Monitor Training: Keep track of metrics like loss, accuracy, and IoU using Tensorboard.
6. Evaluate the Object Detection Model
Run Evaluation: Use YOLOv5’s built-in evaluation scripts to assess the model's performance on the testing dataset.
Hyperparameter Tuning: Experiment with different hyperparameters (e.g., learning rate, number of epochs) and retrain the model to improve performance.
Document Findings: Keep notes on the impact of each hyperparameter change.
7. Train a Custom Semantic Segmentation Model Using PyTorch
Research an Existing Architecture: Find an existing semantic segmentation model (e.g., U-Net, DeepLabV3) to use as a reference.
Implement the Model: Write the model architecture in PyTorch. You can customize it to fit your dataset and requirements.
Prepare the Data: Ensure your dataset is properly formatted for segmentation tasks (e.g., pixel-wise labeling).
Train the Model: Write a training loop for your model, keeping track of metrics like pixel accuracy and IoU.
8. Evaluate the Semantic Segmentation Model
Run Evaluation: Evaluate the model on the testing dataset and analyze metrics.
Tuning and Retraining: Adjust the model's hyperparameters and retrain to improve results.
Document the Process: Similar to the object detection model, keep notes on what changes were made and their effects.
9. Use Tensorboard for Visualization
Set Up Tensorboard: Integrate Tensorboard into your training scripts to log metrics, losses, and images.
Track Metrics: Visualize the evolution of metrics during training for both models.
10. Interpret the Results
Compare Object Detection and Segmentation Models: Analyze the results of both models in terms of:
Accuracy and IoU.
Training time and inference speed.
Impact of different hyperparameters.
Write a Report: Summarize your findings, discuss the strengths and weaknesses of each approach, and explain the differences in performance.
